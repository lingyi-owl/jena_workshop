title: "Alpha diversity"
teaching: 30
exercises: 60
questions:
- "What is alpha diversity?"
- "How to compare alpha diversity between samples"
- "What are the common alpha diversity indices?"
objectives:
- "Run a cross-assembly with all the samples."
- "Understand the parameters used during the cross-assembly."
keypoints:
- "With sequence assembly we get longer, more meaningful genomic fragments from short sequencing reads."
- "In a cross-assembly, reads coming from the same species in different samples are merged into the same scaffold."
