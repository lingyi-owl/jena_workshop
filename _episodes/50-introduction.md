title: "Track alpha and beta diversity dynamics of viral/microbial communities"
teaching: 30
exercises: 60
questions:
- "What is compositional data?"
- "How to do compositional data analysis?"
- "What is Hill Number?"
objectives:
- "Compositionality"
  - "Definition: a D-part composition is positive real vector of D components describing the parts of some whole. It only carries relative information between the parts.
  - "Three principles of compositional data (analysis): scale invariance, permutation invariance, subcompositional coherence  
- "Hill number of alpha divesity"
  - "Hill number is linear"
keypoints:
- "Next Generation Sequencing data is compositional and should be analyzed using compositional data analysis methods"
- "Hill number is linear and more intuitive than original alpha diversity measures"
